# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

This repository is a webscraping app for Mars taking news from the Nasa website [https://mars.nasa.gov/news/](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/), a feature image from [https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/JPL_Space/index.html](https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/JPL_Space/index.html), facts from [http://space-facts.com/mars/](http://space-facts.com/mars/) and hemisphere photos from [https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars). A flask is then set up to display on either browser or mobile including responsiveness. Below is a screenshot of the mobile simulation
